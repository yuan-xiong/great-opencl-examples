# Great OpenCL Examples
This repository provides some free, organized, ready-to-compile and well-documented OpenCL C++ code examples.  [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/) (Open Computing Language) is a royalty-free framework for parallel programming of heterogeneous systems consisting of different processing units (*e.g.* CPU, GPU, FPGA, DSP).  The purpose of this repository is to serve as a reference for everyone interested in learning how to use OpenCL C++ to develop portable applications based on parallel computing. It was first created as a supplemental reference for the Hardware/Software Interface course offered by the [Computer Science Department](http://computacao.ufs.br/pagina/4193) of Universidade Federal de Sergipe during the first semester of 2019.

## Requeriments

The examples in this repository require a valid implementation of OpenCL in your system. To install it, follow the next instructions according to your machine OS:

### Debian/Ubuntu
 
 Install OpenCl headers: 
 
    sudo apt-get install opencl-headers

 Install OpenCL drivers according to your parallel computing device vendor:

 - Intel: `sudo apt-get install beignet-dev`
 - AMD: `sudo apt-get install amd-opencl-dev`
 - Nvidia: `sudo apt-get install nvidia-opencl-dev`

```    
### Windows

The following instructions must be performed to install OpenCL on a Windows/OSX device:

 1. Download the OpenCL SDK: 
	-  Check out the website of your device vendor (*e.g.* Intel, AMD, Nvidia, etc).
 2. Set up OpenCL on your IDE:
	- Add header file (.h) directory to includes;
	- Add OpenCL.lib file to linker settings.

For a visual demonstration of how to set up OpenCL on a Windows platform with Visual Studio, watch this video tutorial: https://youtu.be/mtA94WAxkPM (*credits*: Wesley Shillingford).

## Usage

Each folder in this repository contains the source code of an independent and self-contained OpenCL example. Before running it, you must compile it. To do so with GCC, run the following command in a terminal:

    g++ -std=c++0x -o output src.cpp -lOpenCL

## Bonus: OpenCL + CImg

This repository also provides the OpenCL source code of an image filtering application based on the [CImg](http://cimg.eu/) library. This entire library has the form of a single header file, which is already included in this repository. To compile that source code with GCC, run the following command on a terminal:

    g++ -std=c++0x -o output src.cpp -lOpenCL -lm -lpthread -lX11
